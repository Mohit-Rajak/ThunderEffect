# Thunderstorm Effect Simulation Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This project is a fun and immersive web-based simulation of a thunderstorm, created using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to simulate the natural ambiance of a thunderstorm, complete with flashes of lightning and thunder sounds, providing a realistic and engaging experience for users.

Key Features:

Lightning Animation: The lightning strikes are triggered randomly using CSS animations, where bright flashes appear across the screen, mimicking the sudden brightness of a real thunderstorm. The animation is designed to be smooth and realistic, with the intensity and duration of the lightning strikes being controlled through CSS keyframes.

Thunder Sound Effects: Using JavaScript, thunder sounds are played in sync with the lightning flashes, adding an extra layer of realism. The sound effects are randomized in both frequency and volume, so the experience feels natural and unpredictable, just like a real storm.

Randomized Timing and Frequency: The frequency of the lightning strikes and thunder sounds is controlled dynamically through JavaScript, making the storm feel spontaneous. Each time the page is loaded or refreshed, a new storm pattern is generated, ensuring that users experience a unique event every time.

Responsive Design: The storm simulation adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience whether on mobile, tablet, or desktop devices. The lightning flashes and sound effects will work across all screen types, providing an immersive experience no matter how large or small the display.

Minimalistic Aesthetic: The focus of the project is on the atmospheric effect, so the page features a dark, moody background with soft, ambient styling, allowing the lightning and sound to stand out. The rest of the page is kept simple and unobtrusive, ensuring that the storm simulation is the center of attention.

Technical Overview:

HTML: The structure of the page is simple, with a minimal amount of elements required to set up the container for the storm effect. There are no external dependencies, and all code is lightweight and optimized for performance.

CSS: The styling makes use of key CSS animations to create the lightning flash effect, and transitions are used to handle the smooth fading in and out of the flashes. The CSS handles all the visual elements, ensuring smooth transitions and realistic flashing animations.

JavaScript: JavaScript is used to control the timing and randomization of the lightning strikes and thunder sound effects. A combination of setTimeout and Math.random is used to trigger the effects at unpredictable intervals, simulating the randomness of a real storm. JavaScript also ensures that the thunder sound effects are played in sync with the visual lightning strikes.
